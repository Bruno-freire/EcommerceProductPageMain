# E-commerce product page

This project consists of an e-commerce product page, which has a header section with navigation buttons, a shopping cart and a user profile image. In addition, the page has a section of products with a main image and thumbnails, which can be browsed through a carousel.

The HTML file contains the markup for page elements, including metadata configuration for display and behavior on mobile devices.

The CSS file is responsible for styling page elements such as colors, fonts, sizes, and placement.

The images used on the page are stored in the "images" folder, with the exception of the menu icon and the shopping cart icon, which are located in the project root.
